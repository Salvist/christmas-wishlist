# Richie's Christmas Wishlist

### What are your hobbies?
I have developed new hobbies other than playing computer games!
- Non-fiction books (productivity, habits, communication / how to talk to people, self-development, about life)
- Running / jogging
- Computer games

### Where do you usually shop?
Uniqlo, Amazon, direct websites.

### What color(s) do you prefer?
I prefer monotone and calm colors. Not too many colors at once!

Just one or two colors at once, maybe 3 max. No crazy motifs :joy:

### What size are you in general?
Between S and M. Some days S, some days M.

### Anything specific you would like?
Below are some of the things I can think on top of my head:
- [Fast and Free Running Belt](https://shop.lululemon.com/p/bags/Fast-and-Free-Run-Belt-MD/_/prod9710370?color=48237&sz=S%2FM) $19.
- [Flat Bottom Mug](https://www.amazon.com/LUXU-Lead-Free-Glassware-Cappuccino-Chocolate/dp/B08GL885SD/ref=sr_1_7?crid=21X3QN32NN6NA&keywords=flat%2Bbottom%2Bmug&qid=1700148228&sprefix=flat%2Bbottom%2Bmug%2Caps%2C117&sr=8-7&th=1) $17. Yes, I want a flat bottom mug so it can work with my mug warmer well, no rim / gap at all.
- [Uniqlo Sweater](https://www.uniqlo.com/us/en/products/E460946-000/00?colorDisplayCode=67&sizeDisplayCode=004) $50.

Speaking in theorem, I would like anything that can increase my productivity or keep me warm in the winter :grin::snowflake:

### Anything you wouldn't like?
Things that doesn't last for long like foods, drinks, snacks.
Skin care product, perfume, candles can do!

### Anything you would like to say/add?
Thank you my secret santa! I don't know who you are but thank you!

If you have something in mind better for me then surprise me. You don't have to buy the things I mentioned above.
